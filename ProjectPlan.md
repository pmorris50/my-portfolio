# my-portfolio
## Description
    This is my first webpage, a blank portfolio where I can link my future work. I have made the webpage responsive by using a mix of media queries, grid and flebox CSS properties. 
    As I complete more projects and develop more CSS skills I will update this portfolio page. 

 
## What I learned
    During this project, I learned how to use flexbox and grid to seemingly transition screen sizes. I also learned a webpage will still need media queries to be fully responsive. At least with my current skill level. 

## Future Plans 
    I plan to update my portfolio as I complete projects during and after this bootcamp. I will aslo continually update/change the CSS style as I enhance my CSS skills/time allows

## Application
    Portfolio page for my personal work
